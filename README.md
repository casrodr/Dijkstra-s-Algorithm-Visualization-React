# React Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization

Welcome to the React Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization project! This web application allows users to visualize the famous Dijkstra's algorithm in action for finding the shortest path in a graph. 

## Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js: https://nodejs.org/

## Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-dijkstra-visualization.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd react-dijkstra-visualization
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Project Structure

## The project structure is organized as follows:

src: Contains the source code for the React application.
components: React components used for the visualization.
utils: Utility functions, including the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.
styles: CSS styles for the components.
App.js: Main application component.
index.js: Entry point of the application.

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following key dependencies:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime.
npm: A package manager for JavaScript.
For a complete list of dependencies, please refer to the package.json file.

## Usage
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

## Use the controls to create a graph, set start and end nodes, and visualize Dijkstra's algorithm in action.
